# [Binary Searchable Count](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/binary-searchable-elements/1)
## Medium
Given an array arr[] consisting of n distinct integers, find the maximum count of integers that are binary searchable in the given array. Binary searchable elements are determined using the standard Binary Search implementation described below.

Initially l is 0 and r is size of array - 1&nbsp;
while(l &lt;= r), compute mid as floor of (l + r)/2 and compare with mid.
If the target element is same as mid, return true. Else if mid is smaller, change l = mid + 1, else change r = mid - 1.

For example:

In arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 5], the element 5 is not binary searchable. During Binary Search, the search eventually reaches the subarray containing 6, and since 6 &gt; 5, the search moves left (r = mid - 1), causing the element 5 to be skipped.
In arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6], the element 5 is binary searchable because the standard Binary Search process eventually reaches and finds 5.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2]Output: 2Explanation: arr[0], arr[1] can be found.
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6]Output: 4Explanation: arr[0], arr[2], arr[4], arr[5] can be found.
Constraints:1 ≤ n ≤ 1051 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
